link to deployed page:

This assignment is to build an app that provides weather info by city. A user seeking information about today's forcast, and the forecast for the upcoming 5 days, will be able to search by city and recieve information back from the Open Weather API in an intuitive, efficient user interface. Their city search history will also be saved to local storage on their machines.

The acceptance criteria for this project is as follows:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
