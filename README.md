This assignment is to build an app that provides weather info by city. A user seeking information about today's forcast, and the forecast for the upcoming 5 days, will be able to search by city and recieve information back from the Open Weather API in an intuitive, efficient user interface. Their city search history will also be saved to local storage on their machines.

The given example is as here:![06-server-side-apis-homework-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940864/150286446-cdb2a819-f75d-42f3-a5c2-a4a15fab571b.png)

The acceptance criteria for this project is as follows:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

What I learned: a ton from this one! My code's, as usual, a little spastic as I try to decide if I like working in jQuery or vanilla best...I guess I better just jump on the jQuery train (or something like it) since it seems that that's the way most team go...
Man though, this one was fun! After the head thimping and screams, that is. Extracting the needed data from the API calls and getting it to display dynamically on the page was very satisfying, as was figuring out how to get _exactly_ the place they were talking about to bring back the best weather data for them. Accounting for edge cases brought in some learning experience with modals, as well. All together, I'm satisfied with my final product!
